Banana is the common name for a type of fruit and also the name for the herbaceous plants that grow it. The Banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant. Banana plants are often mistaken for trees. Banana have a false stem (called pseudostem), which is made by the lower part of the leaves. This pseudostem can grow to be two to eight meters tall. Each pseudostem grows from a corm. A pseudostem is able to produce a single bunch of Banana. After fruiting, the pseudostem dies and is replaced. When most Banana are ripe, they turn yellow or, sometimes, red.
